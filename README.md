# Kasper Template - Second HTML & CSS Project 🚀

This is my second project using **HTML** & **CSS**, based on the **Kasper Template** tutorial by Eng. Osama Elzero. Following along with the video, I replicated the design while continuing to improve my web development skills. 

## Project Overview 📄

This project helped me advance my understanding of:
- **Structuring a modern webpage** using HTML elements effectively.
- **Designing with CSS** to create visually appealing layouts.
- **Building a fully responsive** website that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

### Features ✨:
- **Responsive Design**: The template works smoothly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Clean and professional layout**: Suitable for personal portfolios or business websites.
- **Optimized CSS**: I applied best practices to ensure the code is maintainable and scalable.

### What I Learned 💡:
- How to implement responsive design using **media queries**.
- Advanced CSS techniques such as animations and hover effects.
- How to organize and maintain cleaner code structures.
